# Hilo

Another attempt at a version of Hilo game. Its a simple game, but I find it amusing and a good way to practice coding.

Unfortunately I am encountering a compiler crash, the log of which I have put in the file [`Oscar64_Crash.log`](Oscar64_Crash.log).

To debug this crash, I have uploaded the project to GitHub, and I am hoping that [drmortalwombat](https://github.com/drmortalwombat) can help me debug this crash.
